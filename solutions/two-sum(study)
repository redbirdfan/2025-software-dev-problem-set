Need to come up with a quicker solution. To be expected with running a nested loop.  Will need to give more thought to a more efficient answer.

var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    let answer = [];
    for ( i=0 ; i < nums.length-1 ; i++){
        for( j=i+1 ; j < nums.length ; j++) {
        if(nums[i]+nums[j] === target) {
            return [i, j];
            }
        } 
    }
};
Here is my quicker solution.  Removed the nested for loop and used a set. Works far faster.

/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */ 
 /*originally completed with nested for loops, time too run was long.  Trying to improve*/
var twoSum = function(nums, target) {

        let numsSet = new Set();

        for (let i = 0 ; i < nums.length ; i++){
            let searchNum = target - nums[i];
            if(numsSet.has(searchNum)){
                return [nums.indexOf(searchNum), i]
            }else {
                numsSet.add(nums[i])
        }
        }
        }
