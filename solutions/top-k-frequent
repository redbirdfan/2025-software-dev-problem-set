//Working, but thrown off by negative numbers. I am guessing because of an issue with parsing negative numbers, since the minus is seen as a character and not a value. I Will continue to work on this tomorrow.

var topKFrequent = function(nums, k) {
    let tallySheet = {}

    for (i=0 ; i < nums.length ; i++) {
        num = nums[i]

            tallySheet[num] = 1
        } else tallySheet[num]++
    }
        let tallies = Object.entries(tallySheet)
//Had to look sort up for key/value.  This shows we are only concerned with value of the pair to sort. A and B will sort based on difference being positive or not
