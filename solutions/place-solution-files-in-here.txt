Problem 1 - https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/
Return true for duplicate number and false for arrays without any duplicates.  Originally ran nested for loops.  Worked, but took too long and errored out on Leetcode.
Research and used a for each loop, creating a Set in the process.  
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var containsDuplicate = function(nums) {
        let seen = new Set();
        for(let num of nums) {
            if(seen.has(num)){
                return true;
            }
            seen.add(num);
        }
        return false;
    }
