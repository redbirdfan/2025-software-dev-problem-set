https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/

Need to come up with a quicker solution. To be expected with running a nested loop.  Will need to give more thought to a more efficient answer.

var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    let answer = [];
    for ( i=0 ; i < nums.length-1 ; i++){
        for( j=i+1 ; j < nums.length ; j++) {
        if(nums[i]+nums[j] === target) {
            return [i, j];
            }
        } 
    }
};
